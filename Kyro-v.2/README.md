Current Features:
1. Supports music from virtually any http source, YouTube, Soundcloud, Spotify, etc..
2. Has full API support to make a web dashboard with IRT features thanks to WebSocket
3. Just easy to understand code and easy to build off of.
4. Dynamic features including commands

Whats on the Todo:
1. Finish the web dashboard with IRT support.
2. Finish the proxy network 
3. Work on bugs

What our bugs look like:
1. Some Database bugs... ugh
2. Command bugs [Skip, Help, Karaoke, Queue, Play, Playlist]
3. And probably much more...

Our Team:
  - Sadly its just me currently. As i'm the only nerd enough to code this in Kotlin
